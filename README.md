# Mint-Token
The **Funcs** smart contract is an ERC20 token implementation using Solidity `^0.8.22` and compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts `^5.0.0`. Named **Funcs** (symbol: **FUN**), the contract supports minting, burning, and transferring tokens. The owner has exclusive rights to mint new tokens to specified addresses. Built-in ERC20Burnable functionality allows users to burn their own tokens, reducing the total supply. The contract also overrides the standard transfer function to facilitate token transactions between users. This simple and secure contract enables token creation and management for various use cases while adhering to ERC20 standards.
